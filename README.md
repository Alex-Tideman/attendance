## Program Attendance Requirements

Students are expected to arrive on time for class with proper equipment and materials. Students arriving late for any reason shall not be allowed entry to that day’s class at the instructor’s discretion. Tardiness will be recorded as an absence even if a student is allowed into class. An overall attendance rate of at least 90% is required to pass a class. Instructors may request withdrawal from a course or program if absences exceed 80% at any point during a class.

Students who are unable to continue classes for medical reasons or severe personal problems will be required to take a leave of absence until they are able to return to class. Proper documentation will be required to substantiate a student’s withdrawal.
